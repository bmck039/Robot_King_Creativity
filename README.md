Robot designed and coded by Ben McKallip and Collin Cook under advising of Jacob Schrum and Steven Alexander.
This library is still a work in progress but is designed to be used with an Arduino nano and tower pro 9g Servos
Servos: https://tinyurl.com/yfc457us
Breakout board: https://tinyurl.com/ykw8mreh
The microcontroller is an Arduino nano, and the robot will run with any 7.2+ Volt battery with 1.5 Amps current, battery should
be wired through the breakout board VIN port.
This library contains many methods to make addressing each leg and each servo much easier, adds methods for moving the robot as well.
Inverse kinematics and related calculations are done within this library

Still in Beta, work in progress
